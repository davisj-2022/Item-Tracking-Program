# Item-Tracking-Program
Project 3

1.  Use C++ to develop a menu display that asks users what they would like to do. Include options for each of the three requirements outlined in the scenario and number them 1, 2, and 3. You should also include an option 4 to exit the program. All of your code needs to effectively validate user input. <br>
<br>
2. Create code to determine the number of times each individual item appears. <br>
<br>Write C++ code for when a user selects option 1 from the menu. Select and apply a C++ function to call the appropriate Python function, which will display the number of times each item (or word) appears.<br>
Write Python code to calculate the frequency of every word that appears from the input file. It is recommended that you build off the code you have already been given for this work.<br>
Use Python to display the final result of items and their corresponding numeric value on the screen.<br>
